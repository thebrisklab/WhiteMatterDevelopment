# 1) drop interaction f test, redo figure 5 to have 1 month, 3 months, 6 months

# FIGURE HAS BEEN UPDATED

# 2) redo sex effects as separate figure

# FIGURE HAS BEEN UPDATED

# 3) Mahalanobis distance: update using FA, AD, RD, MD

# UPDATED USING FA, AD, RD. Can't do all four because variance not invertible

# 4) create tract specific ga and chronological age plots

Done

Note:  some weird things happen on specific tracts. FX MD starts not significantly
different, then becomes significantly. ATR never has a difference curve indicating
significance, although the anova decomposition indicates significance. 

  
# 5) extract percentage change for change rates

# DONE
